Furthermore, cloud-scale data center networks often times have software and operational requirements that may not be well addressed by the switch vendors.\nIn this paper, we present our ongoing experiences on overcoming the complexity and scaling issues that we face when designing, developing, deploying and operating an in-house software built to manage and support a set of features required for data center switches of a large scale Internet content provider. We present FBOSS, our own data center switch software, that is designed with the basis on our switch-as-a-server and deploy-early-and-iterate principles. We treat software running on data center switches as any other software services that run on a commodity server. We also build and deploy only a minimal number of features and iterate on it. These principles allow us to rapidly iterate, test, deploy and manage FBOSS at scale. Over the last five years, our experiences show that FBOSS's design principles allow us to quickly build a stable and scalable network. As evidence, we have successfully grown the number of FBOSS instances running in our data center by over 30x over a two year period.","tags":[],"title":"FBOSS: Building Switch Software at Scale","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sean Choi","Boris Burkov","Alex Eckert","Tian Fang","Saman Kazemkhani","Rob Sherwood","Ying Zhang","Hongyi Zeng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"5514c86263c735071e65127fc371373a","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/publication/choi-2018-fbs-3230543-3230546/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T01:08:49.62221Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choi-2018-fbs-3230543-3230546/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"FBOSS\"","\"Facebook\"","\"data center networks\"","\"network management\"","\"network monitoring\"","\"switch software design\""],"title":"FBOSS: Building Switch Software at Scale","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Choi","Changhoon Kim","Robert Soulé","Jongkeun Lee","Milad Sharif","Xin Jin","Nick McKeown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510953213,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510953213,"objectID":"e1e825b303195b65efe846ce7555cf7a","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/talk/riley/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T14:13:33-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/riley/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Riley: Pushing networking to the edge","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498511528,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498511528,"objectID":"b40dc9d51873fc6e340cbc84fd6d9a9c","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/talk/pvpp_intel/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T14:12:08-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pvpp_intel/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PVPP: A Programmable Vector Packet Processor","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1495141819,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495141819,"objectID":"dc30c2a468b93175172afcf16518ad02","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/talk/pvpp_cisco/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T14:10:19-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pvpp_cisco/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PVPP : A Programmable Vector Packet Processor","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Eyal Cidon","Sean Choi","Sachin Katti","Nick McKeown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a7e663627679886705df13e208abe7df","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/publication/cidon-2017-aal-3106989-3106998/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T01:08:49.788118Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cidon-2017-aal-3106989-3106998/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"Key-Value Stores\"","\"Load Balancing\"","\"Programmable Switches\""],"title":"AppSwitch: Application-layer Load Balancing Within a Software Switch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Choi","Xiang Long","Muhammad Shahbaz","Skip Booth","Andy Keep","John Marshall","Changhoon Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"a39be681c3b23fa1ce886c20618b90ff","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/publication/choi-2017-cfl-3106989-3107000/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T01:08:49.706142Z","relpermalink":"/publication/choi-2017-cfl-3106989-3107000/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"FD.io\"","\"P4\"","\"PVPP\"","\"Programmable Data Plane\"","\"Software Switch\"","\"Vector Packet Processing (VPP)\""],"title":"The Case for a Flexible Low-Level Backend for Software Data Planes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472159149,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472159149,"objectID":"1d9c69892b2f4cc87cf96b01a8102e8f","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/talk/pisces/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T14:05:49-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/pisces/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PISCES -

Inspired by recent bioprinting and imaging research, we have developed a low-cost, networkable, scalable bioprinter with integrated imaging that enables automated fluid deposition with monitoring biological materials over a large area that can interface with standard plasticware. We re-engineered a desktop printer and scanner with mechanical workarounds (rather than software) to leverage the unmodified software, creating a complete system for ∼$700. We found that the resulting print accuracy and precision of this system were close to those of the unmodified printer and scanner. We demonstrate the reach of this system by printing multiple strains of Escherichia coli, performing quantitative time-lapse recordings of bacterial growth, and then separating different fluorescent strains according to color. A fluid-deposition and imaging platform, like the one developed here, could be integrated for do-it-yourself research, remote experimentation, and (on-line) education.","tags":null,"title":"Integrated bioprinting and imaging for scalable, networkable desktop experimentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lily Wu","Sam Shah","Sean Choi","Mitul Tiwari","Christian Posse"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"f494221bd48747e827ffc8aa79eecaef","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/publication/browsemap/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T01:08:50.127043Z","relpermalink":"/publication/browsemap/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The browsemaps: Collaborative filtering at LinkedIn","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Choi","Elena Grewal","Kai Wen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346457600,"objectID":"bfce12eb2bc29fd7507f9b3a4c9d3ef4","permalink":"https://seanschoi.com/publication/social-data/","publishdate":"2020-08-31T01:08:50.2082Z","relpermalink":"/publication/social-data/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Social Data and College Statistics","type":"publication"}]
